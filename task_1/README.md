This notebook contains coding practice from the Pennylane Codebook. The challenges [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/#01-introduction-to-quantum-computing), [Single-Qubit Gates](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/#02-single-qubit-gates), and [Circuits with Many Qubits](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/#03-circuits-many-qubits) were completed there. Some modifications has been made and copy-pasted the codes here to showcase the fulfilment of task-1 of the project.
