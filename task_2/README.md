# About task:
This notebook is an adaptation of the referenced notebook. My contributions include:

- **Dataset selection:** Worked on a different dataset, [Penguin Dataset: The New Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/penguin-dataset-the-new-iris) from Kaggle. I previously worked with this dataset using classical machine learning techniques. You can find my earlier work [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/asadullahgalib/penguin-species-classification-with-kfold-cv).
- **Feature engineering:** Performed some feature engineering steps, eg. exploratory data analysis(EDA), handling nan values, normalization, etc.
- **Problem simplification:** While the original dataset presents a multiclass challenge with three species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap), I focused on a binary classification problem by selecting only Gentoo and Chinstrap species.
